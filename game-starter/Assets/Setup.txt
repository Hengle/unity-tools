3D Lighting Instructions:
  Use Legacy Diffuse for most 3D materials.
  Have a scene lighting of ambient color and make it #D9D9D9 (which is white #FFFFFF at %85 intensity)
  Have an all white #FFFFFF directional light with effectively %15 intensity on the ground.
  To figure out the directional light intensity use the following:
    cos(angle) * intensity = 0.15
    intensity = 0.15 / cos(angle)
  Where angle is the the angle between light direction and Down direction
